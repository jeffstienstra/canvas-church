                            A canvas for painting: either blank with infinite possibilities or a completed masterpiece with a unique beauty
                            that cannot be replicated.
                        </li>
                        <li className='mt-2 indent-[-20px]'>
                            A canvas tent: either a dwelling for rest and shelter, or a large covering for gathering and celebration.
                        </li>

                    These ideas of what a canvas can be reminds us not only of what we want our community to
                    be but also of who we already are.

                        Canvas Church wants to be a place where the complete beauty of each person is recognized and celebrated while looking forward
                        to the ways that God will bring us together to create infinitely new and beautiful things as a community.
                    </p>
                    <p className='my-4 text-justify'>
                        We want to be a place where anyone can come and find shelter, refuge, and rest from the pain and brokenness of the world
                        while also being a place where we can celebrate the ways in which Godâ€™s faithfulness has brought healing, joy, and energy.

                        We want to be present in our community, connected with our neighbors, and helping to meet the needs of those around us. Not
                        with some ulterior motive, but out of the desire to love others simply because they are.
